1. ucfdataout.cpp

  This is a C++ source file for a program that generates a newer version 
of srell_ucfdata.hpp, which is a C++ source file that SRELL includes for 
case-folding. It is generated by ucfdataout with CaseFolding.txt provided 
by the Unicode Consortium.

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Note 1: CaseFolding.txt
  |
  |   It is a data file needed for case-insensitive matching based on the
  | Unicode Standard. When a new version of the Unicode Standard is released,
  | CaseFolding.txt may also be updated accordingly.
  |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1-1. Usage

    1) compile ucfdataout.cpp,
    2) get the latest version of CaseFolding.txt, which is available at
       http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt ,
    3) put CaseFolding.txt and a binary file generated at 1) in the same
       directory and run the binary file,
    4) move the newly generated srell_ucfdata.hpp to the directory in where
       SRELL is put.
